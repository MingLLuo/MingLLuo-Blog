- 字典推导式: `{c: x for c, x in lst}
- 拆包: `**dict` 

```python
>>> {'a': 0, **{'x': 1}, 'y': 2, **{'z': 3, 'x': 4}} 
{'a': 0, 'x': 4, 'y': 2, 'z': 3}
```
- 合并映射(Merging Mappings): `|, |=, d1 | d2`
- match/case: 模式匹配，模式中key的顺序无关紧要
- 可哈希
>An object is _hashable_ if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a `__hash__()` method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an `__eq__()` method). Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value.
>Most of Python’s immutable built-in objects are hashable; mutable containers (such as lists or dictionaries) are not; immutable containers (such as tuples and frozensets) are only hashable if their elements are hashable. Objects which are instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default. They all compare unequal (except with themselves), and their hash value is derived from their [`id()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#id "id").

- With Python’s fail-fast philosophy, dict access with `d[k]` raises an error when k is not an existing key
	- 可以替换`d[k]`为`d.get(k, default)`
	- 使用`defaultdict`代替`dict`
	- 实现`__missing__`
